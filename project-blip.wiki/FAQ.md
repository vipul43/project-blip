## Why is my donation tracked partially?
The donation tracking depends on the length of the network that we have associated with. The more donation centers and hospitals get associated with us, the larger network we build. With large network, you are likely to track your donation till termination. You are partially viewing the donation because our chain might be broken after some point. But you stay tuned and share about us, the more you share, the larger the network we build and connect the chains at later points. You can continue tracking the donation once the chain is extended by making newer connections. Out solution offers fool-proof tracking, even with no connections, we can restore tracking once the connections are made. So stay connected with us!!
