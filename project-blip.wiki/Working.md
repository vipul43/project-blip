# Working

## User POV

- The User gets to register on the Project BLiP web application as a _donor_. After registering the User is redirected to their personal donations dashboard where they will get to track all their donations made using the Project BLiP platform. Whenever a donation is made at Project BLiP associated Donation Center User will receive a unique _Donation Id_ to their email or mobile phone. Which they can use to add that donation to their personal donations list and later track it through various stages.
- Other than tracking User can also view all Project BLiP associated donation centers and their info in the nearest order. User can visit their nearest center and make the donation work.
- After the first donation, the next donation timer sets off. The timer will indicate when the User will get ready to make the next donation.
- Users can also view the customised diet plan immediately after their first donation, to cater to the speedy recovery of the User.
- The User keeps on levelling up with each donation and earns badges that can be shared on social media platforms to show off and in the process motivate others to join the community.

## Donation Center POV

- The Donation Center associated with Project BLiP is preferred compared to a non-associated Donation Center by the User as they get to know the tracking status of their donation and further earn additional perks and rewards.
- The entries made by Donation Centers regarding the Donation work will help accurately know the tracking status of the donation and in turn let donors know the tracking status.

## Hospital POV

- Hospitals can choose to credit the Users who have made invaluable donation works which helped in saving lives by associating with Project BLiP.
- The entries made by Hospital regarding the Donation work will help accurately know the tracking status of the donation and in turn let donors know the tracking status.

## Admin POV

- Users can directly signup on the platform and get access to the list of donation centers near them and the ones associated with Project BLiP.
- After making a donation they receive a donation id on their email or phone by the details they provide at the donation center.
- Donation Center and Hospital don't have direct access to platform, they first need to get associated with platform after that admin adds the corresponding partner as associated partner. After that they can add donation details onto the Project BLiP platform.

## Statistics

- Each Donation work is meticulously stored along with the geographical location of donation, time of donation, type of donation, etc. This will contribute to generating the statistics.
- The statistics can in turn help to spread awareness in the regions where donation work is more required with the help of the local Non-Profitable Organisations.
- The statistics is displayed on the home page for public display.

## Share Perks

- Users get a customised share perk right after their first donation. And the share perk keeps on levelling up with each donation made.
- The share perk is a unique piece of art that displays users individuality and Q&Q of the donations made.
- User can share these pieces of art on social media and boast off their humanitarian work, alongside spreading awareness about Project BLiP and thus getting more and more people involved with Project BLiP.

## Rewards

- Tracking their donation is in itself a very great motive to make many more donations. The motive is further more driven with the help of rewards.
- User can earn rewards with more and more donation works, in addition to share perks.
