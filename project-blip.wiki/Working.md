## User POV
- The User gets to register on the Project BLiP web application as a *donor*. After registering the User is redirected to his personal donations dashboard where they will get to track all their donations made using the Project BLiP platform. Whenever a donation is made at Project BLiP associated Donation Center User will receive a unique *Blood Id* to his mobile phone. Which they can use to add that donation to their personal donations list and later track it through various stages.  
- Other than tracking User can also view all Project BLiP associated donation centers and their info in the nearest order. User can visit their nearest center and make the donation work.  
- After the first donation, the next donation timer sets off. The timer will indicate when the User will get ready to make the next donation.  
- Users can also view the customized diet plan immediately after their first donation, to cater to the speedy recovery of the User.  
- The User keeps on leveling up with each donation and earns badges that can be shared on social media platforms to show off and in the process motivate others to join the community.
