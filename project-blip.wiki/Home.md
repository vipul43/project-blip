# Project BLiP

Beginning of the idea
---
"Every day 12,000 people in India die due to a lack of donated blood. India collects 11 million units of blood but needs 15 million units, so there's a deficit of 4 million units of blood" -- The New Indian Express <br />
Every person can start to donate blood from the age of 18 yrs to the age of 65yrs with the exception of some health conditions. If we at least consider the age group 20 yrs to 44 yrs, there are at least 373 million (373,772,951 according to consensus 2001) people who can donate. And if the health conditions are also taken into account let us assume there are around 50 million healthy donors(there are some pretty serious restrictions on blood donations). Each healthy donor can donate 350 ml to 470 ml quantity of blood. If all the healthy donors donate blood(consider 400 ml average blood donation per healthy donor), it sums up to 38 million units of blood. More than enough to fill in the gap of 4 million units of blood. The donated blood is reformed within 24 hrs to 48 hrs and red blood cells get reformed within 10 weeks to 12 weeks. That means the healthy donors can donate again in 3 months period. Completely sufficient to make the every day death count due to lack of donated blood go down to zero.

```Motto: Don't let your humanity go in vain```

There is humanity in every individual, but sometimes its deep and dormant. We tap that humanity by invoking ego.
Healthy donors can now **track thier donated blood**, like **what components the blood is divided into**, **where each component is now at**, **in which hospital it is used**, **how many lives are saved**, also **share it on social media**, **get reminded of regular donation periods**, **donation campaigns**, **donation requirements**.

How does it benefit Project BLiP?
---
Project BLiP ties up with blood banks and hospitals, hosts blood donation campaigns upon the requirement by banks and hospitals. Also, issues alerts upon urgent requirement of blood. Collects statistics regarding each blood donation made and serves it to trusted and authorised Organisations to help them identify the underlying problem of donation in backward areas, and conduct more blood donation camps in such areas.
